# Rust Async and Concurrency

Async functions, tokio runtime, streams, threads, channels, and shared state.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when:
- Writing async functions with tokio
- Running concurrent async operations with join! or spawn
- Processing async streams
- Spawning OS threads
- Using channels (mpsc) for message passing
- Sharing state with Arc and Mutex

For async patterns, concurrency primitives, and shared state examples, see `references/async.md`.
