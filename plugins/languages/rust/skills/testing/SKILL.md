# Rust Testing and Cargo

Unit tests, integration tests, Cargo.toml configuration, and common commands.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when:
- Writing unit tests with #[test] and #[cfg(test)]
- Setting up integration tests in tests/ directory
- Configuring Cargo.toml dependencies and profiles
- Running cargo test, build, clippy, or fmt
- Using #[should_panic] or Result-returning tests

For test patterns, Cargo.toml configuration, and command reference, see `references/testing.md`.
