# Rust Ownership and Borrowing

Ownership rules, borrowing, slices, and lifetimes.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when:
- Understanding ownership and move semantics
- Working with references and borrowing rules
- Using string or array slices
- Annotating or debugging lifetimes
- Fixing borrow checker errors

For ownership rules, borrowing patterns, slices, and lifetime annotations, see `references/ownership.md`.
