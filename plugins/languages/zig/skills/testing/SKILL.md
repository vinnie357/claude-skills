# Zig Testing

Built-in test framework, leak detection, and CI integration.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when:
- Writing unit tests in Zig
- Using the test allocator for memory leak detection
- Configuring test steps in build.zig
- Filtering and running specific tests
- Skipping platform-specific tests

For assertion functions, test allocator patterns, and build integration, see `references/testing.md`.
