# Zig C Interop

Importing C libraries, exporting Zig to C, type mappings, and translate-c.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when:
- Importing C headers with @cImport/@cInclude
- Exporting Zig functions for C consumption
- Mapping between Zig and C types
- Using the translate-c tool
- Linking C libraries in build.zig

For type mappings, linking patterns, and string interop examples, see `references/c-interop.md`.
