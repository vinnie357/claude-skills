# Zig Allocators

Memory management patterns, allocator types, and allocation lifecycle.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when:
- Choosing an allocator for a specific use case
- Managing memory allocation and deallocation
- Debugging memory leaks or use-after-free
- Writing allocator-aware library code

For allocator types, patterns, and examples, see `references/allocators.md`.
