One task = one branch = one PR\n2. Claim before working: bd update --status in_progress\n3. Close with reason: Documents what was done\n4. Minimal PRs: Title + bullets only\n5. Wait for user: Never auto-merge or assume approval\n6. Clean up: Delete local branch after merge\n\n## Files to Update\n- core/skills/beads/SKILL.md\n- core/agents/beads-worker/AGENT.md (or similar)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"vinnie.mazza@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-25T11:14:23.485172-05:00","created_by":"Vinnie Mazza","updated_at":"2026-01-25T11:29:19.931315-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-25T11:29:19.931315-05:00","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["beads","documentation"]}
